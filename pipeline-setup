Using the following yaml as reference, AWS Code pipeline can be setup which takes github as the source repo, build and deploy the code directly to AWS Web Servers..
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/code-samples/latest/catalog/cloudformation-codepipeline-template-codepipeline-github-events-yaml.yml.html

Yaml based pipeline helps in adding the file to repo and maintaining version control instead of setting up the pipeline using UI. 

The artifacts generated after build can be saved to S3 to maintain durable storage if the need to redeploy previous release (in this case 90 days) is required.

Cloudfront setup is required to redirect all http traffic to https and also for reduced latency (which avoids pulling in data from S3 everytime instead)
